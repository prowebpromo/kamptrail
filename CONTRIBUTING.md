# Contributing to KampTrail

## Quick start
1. Fork this repo and create a branch: `feature/your-change`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Run Lighthouse locally (Chrome → DevTools → Lighthouse) aiming for **PWA & Performance ≥ 0.90**.
4. Commit and open a Pull Request. The **Lighthouse CI** workflow will run on your PR.

## Coding standards
- Keep HTML semantic and accessible (focus states, labels, ARIA where appropriate).
- Keep the PWA offline experience working (test offline after changes).

## Branching
- `main` is always deployable.
- Feature branches: `feature/...`.
